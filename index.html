      <strong>Techpa</strong> | <em>Data Analyst</em><br/>
      <br/>Collaborating with cross-functional teams (tech, modeling, and data stewardship), I deliver data solutions for multi-branch retail chains like JK Mart. By cleaning and merging complex datasets (transactions, inventory, customer interactions), I ensured <strong>95%+ data accuracy</strong> for strategic decisions. My Tableau dashboards and PDF reports on sales trends and promo ROI drove a <strong>15% increase in campaign conversions</strong> and <strong>20% faster restocking</strong>, while KPI tracking reduced branch performance variability by <strong>18%</strong>, directly boosting revenue in struggling locations.<br/><br/>

      Pioneered a low-stock alert system that cut stockouts by <strong>25%</strong> (<strong>$200K annual savings</strong>), and optimized Maliban Biscuits' regional strategies to achieve <strong>15% YoY sales growth</strong> (contributing to <strong>0.3% overall revenue lift</strong>). Forensic data analysis resolved <strong>40% of accounting discrepancies</strong> at JK Mart's Civil Lines branch, complemented by training programs that improved reconciliation accuracy.<br/><br/>

      Leading a team, I developed a <strong>multi-tenant Employee Management Dashboard</strong> with CRUD operations, payment processing, and attendance tracking, enhancing managerial efficiency by <strong>30%</strong>. Recognized by the CTO for "<strong>Exceptional Leadership</strong>" in bridging engineering-client gaps during the app rollout.

      <strong>Ignitus, USA</strong> | <em>Machine Learning Engineer Intern</em><br/>
      <br/>As part of an interdisciplinary team, I developed <strong>NLP models in TensorFlow</strong> to detect and differentiate between suicidal tendencies and depression in US teenagers/adults, achieving <strong>over 90% accuracy</strong> to support early mental health intervention. Collaborating closely with clinical and data science teams, I co-developed models that reduced false positives in depression detection by <strong>22%</strong>, earning the "<strong>Best Team Player</strong>" award for bridging cross-functional expertise.
